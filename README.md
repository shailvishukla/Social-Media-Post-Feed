# Real-Time Social Media Feed with Socket.IO and React

This project is a real-time social media post feed application built with a modern tech stack. It provides a seamless user experience by enabling dynamic content updates using Socket.IO for real-time communication between the server and clients. The project consists of a backend developed with Node.js and Express, a frontend built with React.js using Material-UI, and a PostgreSQL database for data storage.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Post and Comment Updates:** 
  - Users can create new posts with captions and optional image uploads.
  - Posts and comments are updated in real-time across all clients without the need for page reloads, powered by Socket.IO.
  - New posts and comments are broadcasted to all connected users immediately upon creation.

- **Infinite Scroll:** 
  - The post feed is loaded incrementally using infinite scrolling, which fetches more posts as the user scrolls down, optimizing performance and user experience.

- **Image Uploading:** 
  - Users can upload images with their posts, which are stored on the server and displayed within the post feed.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The user interface is designed with Material-UI components, ensuring a consistent and responsive experience across different devices.

- **Socket.IO Integration:**
  - Replaces traditional RESTful API calls with real-time socket communication, reducing latency and providing instantaneous data updates.
  - Server handles events like fetching posts, creating new posts, and adding comments, broadcasting relevant updates to connected clients.

- **PostgreSQL Database:** 
  - Data is stored and managed using a PostgreSQL database, with Sequelize ORM handling database operations and relationships between users, posts, and comments.

- **Comment System:** 
  - Each post can receive comments, which are also updated in real-time as users interact with the feed.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, Material-UI, Infinite Scroll Component
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Sequelize ORM
- **File Handling:** Multer for image uploads
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO for event-driven updates

## How It Works
- **Frontend:** Users interact with the post feed, creating new posts and comments. The interface dynamically updates using React's state management and socket events, ensuring all users see the latest content without reloading the page.

- **Backend:** The Node.js server listens for socket events from clients, fetches data from PostgreSQL using Sequelize, and emits updates back to clients. Real-time data exchange is handled efficiently through Socket.IO.

- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores users, posts, and comments, with relationships defined using Sequelize. The backend retrieves and sends data as requested by the frontend.
